# Student Support

Your welfare during your PhD is of the utmost importance to us and you will have access to two main forms of independent support as a student on this programme.

## Support from your University

### Year 1

All our first year students will be registered with a member of our [Executive Board](course_docs/staff.md) at your home university. You should have been informed of who this is either by your home university or by us. They will act as your *Graduate Tutor/Supervisor* in Year 1 of the programme and provide support during the first year of the programme. Please note that this is not the same as your *PhD Research Supervisor(s)* who will not be chosen until the end of Year 1. Your home university may also allocate other academic staff to support you during your PhD studies.

Your home university should provide you with information detailing their institutional student welfare support provisions during your induction or at some point during your first year of study. If you do not feel you have been advised of this information then please contact your home university graduate tutor in the first instance. 

### Years 2-4

After you have chosen your main PhD research topic and supervisory team at the end of Year 1, your academic support will normally transfer from your Year 1 graduate tutor to the lead research supervisor and any additional members of the supervisory team as appropriate. They will often be your first destination for further support but where applicable you may wish to use other home university resources and services. Please consult your home university student services for details.

### Student Wellbeing ###
Taking care of your mental health and wellbeing is important to us.  Your home university provides a dedicated service for students where you can access support, advice, and guidance on how to look after your mental health and wellbeing throughout your PhD studies.  You can also find out about Disability Support Services provision as well as range of other student support services.

## Support from us

Our students will also uniquely have support external to their university via the programme. This could be members of the Programme Operations Team or members of the Executive Board not at your University.

### The Directors

The Programme Directors should be advised if you are experiencing any difficulties with your studies either because of challenges presented by your working environment or in your personal life. We will provide support to help you overcome any challenges where your home university cannot provide this.

### Programme Administration

The Programme Administration team should be advised if you are experiencing any difficulties with your studies because of administrative problems. Examples might include financial issues with payments of fees or stipends, visa issues for international students, official student documentation, etc. If you are sick or unable to attend planned training activities, the Administration team should be informed in the first instance.

### Executive Board

Our Executive Board consists of highly experienced academics with a wide range of experience across a number of scientific and non-scientific disciplines. Our students are welcome to draw upon these experiences where they require subject- or discipline-specific advice in relation to their research studies or professional development. However, issues which are personal in nature or not research specific should first be directed to the Programme Directors.
